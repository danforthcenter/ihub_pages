# Welcome to the revamped Ionomics hub


The IonomicsHub (iHUB) was first accessible to the public in 2007 as the Purdue Ionomics Information Management System (PiiMS). Hosted at Purdue University, the system provided integrated workflow control, data storage, and analysis to facilitate high-throughput ionomic data collection, along with integrated tools for data search, retrieval, visualization, and creation of DOIs associated with sets of data [(Baxter et al., 2007)](www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/doi/10.1104/pp.106.092528). 

Ionomic data collected on Arabidopsis thaliana shoot samples was actively loaded onto the iHUB from 2002 â€“ 2011. It contained ionomics data on 205,169 unique A. thaliana samples. This represented approximately 4,000,000 publically accessible data points from 15,369 unique lines/accessions, and includes 11,478 fast neutron mutagenized plants, 28,357 T-DNA mutagenized plants (representing 3,452 genes), 21,960 EMS mutagenized plants, and 40,388 wild-type plants including 753 different accessions and 1,474 inbred lines. Over the years the system was upgraded with the addition of various features (e.g. [Salt et al., 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2567948.2577033)), and extended to host data on 26,268 rice samples and 51,554 Saccharomyces cerevisiae samples, including a genome-wide set of knockout and over expression strains [(Yu et al., 2012)](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/623). Since it went live the iHUB had 15,423 unique users from 124 countries.

In 2019 the iHUB was moved to the University of Nottingham where it underwent extensive software upgrades. In 2018 the iHUB domain name ionomicshub.org was renewed by Purdue University for 5 years. Unfortunately, when the domain name came up for renewal in 2023 it was mistakenly not renewed, and was bought by a third party. This third party was unwilling to sell the domain name back to the iHUB. Owners of the ionomicshub.org domain are now using the domain to host their own website, where they are also using the iHUB logo without permission. To be clear: Despite the use of the iononomicshub logo and scraped text from the old ionomicshub.org, neither David Salt nor Ivan Baxter have any association with the current ionomicshub.org. The current owners do not have the data they are claiming. 

Unfortunately, the ionomicshub.org address was hardcoded into the underlying code, so the full ionomicshub system crashed and we have been unable to resurrect it. To continue to provide community access to the ionomics data that was hosted at the iHUB, we have deposited the underlying datasets at Zenodo and linked them from this site using the ionomicshub.work domain. Here, we provide links for download of files containing ionomic data from the iHUB on *A. thaliana* and *S. cerevisiae*. This site no longer provides the ability to upload data, or perform searches, visualization or data set and DOI generation. The ionomicshub.work domain is owned by Ivan Baxter and it is our intention to maintain this site in perpetuity as a reference for the community. If we are able to recover additional data from the original ionomicshub.org or if others have deposited additional ionomics datasets on public repositories, we will be happy to add links to that data. 

File of Arabidopsis thaliana shoot ionomic data
    
    1. Elemental concentrations (showing the isotope used for quantification) normalized to sample weight, units ppm. Data shown as median values . Metadata associated with samples including growth conditions, line name and genetic background also shown.
    
    2. Zscore (showing the isotope used for quantification) normalized to either average of wild-type genetic background or sample set average, using weight normalised data. Data shown as median values. Metadata associated with samples including growth conditions, line name and genetic background also shown.
    
    3. Elemental concentrations (showing the isotope used for quantification) normalized to sample weight, units ppm for leaf tissue of A. thaliana 1001 collection with replicate samples, and normalization, as described in Campos et al., (2021)(DOI @ : https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.15177). 
    
    4. Elemental concentrations (showing the isotope used for quantification) normalized to sample weight, units ppm for seed tissue of A. thaliana 1001 collection with replicate samples, and normalization, as described in Campos et al., (2021).
    
    5. Elemental concentrations (showing the isotope used for quantification) for leaf and seed tissue of A. thaliana 1001 showing a single fully normalized value for each accession as described in Campos et al., (2021). Data downloaded from https://ffionexplorer.nottingham.ac.uk/ionmap/ 29/06/2025.

Files of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ionomic data
    
    1. Elemental concentrations (showing the isotope used for quantification) showing individual replicate samples in units of ppb divided by the optical density of the culture and normalized using the method described in Yu et al., (2012) for genome-wide knockout (haploid and diploid) and overexpression collection
    
    2. Elemental concentrations (showing the isotope used for quantification) showing zstat score for each line (replicates not shown) normalized using the method described in Yu et al., (2012) for genome-wide knockout (haploid and diploid) and overexpression collection.

| 53      | IPSRI.2015.2016.IonomicsData.csv contains measurements of elemental concentrations for the  Illinois Protein Strain Recombinant Inbred (IPSRI) population grown at UIUC in 2015 and 2016. There is a row for each seed measured, multiple seeds were measured per plot. Concentrations were normalized for sample weight and corrected for batch effects by extracting the residuals from this linear model:Phenotype ~ batch + kernelWeight. Thus, each phenotype can be interpreted as concentration (in parts-per-billion) above or below the population mean. Extreme analytical outliers have been removed from this dataset. The SingleSeedWeight is the weight of the kernel digested and analyzed for ionomics in milligrams.
